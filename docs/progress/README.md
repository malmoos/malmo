# Implementation progress

ADR-style entries — one per unit of work. Each records **what was done** and
**what's next**, so the history of the build is legible without reading every
commit. Entries are named by kebab-slug (`<slug>.md`) and are **not numbered** —
sequential numbering was dropped because parallel branches kept colliding on the
next number.

Because the filename no longer carries order, **the [Index](#index) below is the
only record of build order** — entries are listed oldest-first and a new entry is
**appended to the bottom**, never inserted mid-list. Keep that order; it's the
chronological spine the old `NNNN-` prefix used to provide.

Every change ships with a progress entry or an update to one (see
[`../../CLAUDE.md`](../../CLAUDE.md) # Documentation discipline).

## Up next

The implementation slice queue, ordered. Each item links back to the progress entry whose "what's next" it satisfies. Pull the top item; when it lands, write the next entry and re-order. Design topics (not implementation slices) live in [`../specs/NEXT.md`](../specs/NEXT.md).

This is the **maintainer's critical-path** queue. Work carved off for **parallel contributors** lives in [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/onel/malmo/issues) (some items there are pulled from these "what's next" follow-ups). The two are kept from overlapping on purpose. See [`../dev/contributing.md`](../dev/contributing.md) for the contributor loop.

1. **Notification follow-ups: mute settings UI + retention.** [notification-category-mute.md](notification-category-mute.md) landed per-user **per-category mute** (brain: `notification_mutes` table + read-time filter on list/count/mark-all + `GET`/`PUT`/`DELETE` mute API); [notification-clears-transparency.md](notification-clears-transparency.md) the member **transparency variant** and the **"all clear"** on resolve; [notification-web-ui.md](notification-web-ui.md) the dashboard bell (UI); [notification-read-surface.md](notification-read-surface.md) the read surface; [health-notifications.md](health-notifications.md) the write seam. Remaining: the **mute settings-toggle UI** (`WEB_UI.md`) — a per-category toggle list over the new mute API; then **retention/pruning** for `notifications` + `notification_reads` (`NEXT.md` # Observability). Follow-up from [notification-category-mute.md](notification-category-mute.md).
2. **GPU + device capacity enforcement.** `install-permissions-enforcement.md` deferred `gpu` enforcement and device-existence validation (both need a host hardware-introspection endpoint). A 422 from the brain will surface correctly in the UI via the existing `dialogError` path ([install-consent-ui.md](install-consent-ui.md)) once the host endpoint lands. See `NEXT.md` # GPU.

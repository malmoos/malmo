    <!-- The content wrapper is min-h-full (fills the viewport when short, grows
         with content when long) rather than a fixed h-full box — a fixed box lets
         tall pages overflow *past* the scroll clearance, so the fixed dock would
         cover the last rows. flex-col so a full-height section (Settings' logs
         pane) can still flex-1 to fill.
         `main` itself must be flex/flex-col (not just a flex *item* of the shell)
         so the wrapper below is a genuine flex item of it — only then does the
         wrapper's resolved height count as "definite" for percentage/flex-basis
         resolution in its descendants. Without this, min-h-full's floor only
         behaves like a real height while content is shorter than the viewport;
         once content (e.g. an expanded Settings logs pane) is taller, the whole
         h-full/flex-1 chain below stops being clamped and grows unbounded instead
         of scrolling internally. w-full on the wrapper restores full-width sizing
         under max-w-6xl/mx-auto, since a flex item with auto margins on the cross
         axis opts out of the default stretch sizing. -->

        <!-- Dock clearance. This MUST be a real flex child, not padding on the
             wrapper: a flex + overflow-y-auto scroll container drops trailing
             padding-bottom from its scrollable height (verified in Chrome), so a
             pb-* here leaves the last rows stranded behind the fixed dock. A
             shrink-0 spacer is counted in scrollHeight, so any page can always
             scroll its last row clear of the dock. -->
